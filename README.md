VoiceAssistant is a resource-efficient and customizable voice assistant that is still in the early stages of development but already functional. 🚀

Privacy is our top priority, and VoiceAssistant ensures that all operations are performed offline on your local device, keeping your data secure and protected. 🔒

## Goal 🎯

The main goal of VoiceAssistant is to provide a fully customizable and extendable voice assistant that can be controlled entirely using voice commands. 🌟

## Features ✨

- Fully customizable and extendable (I'm still working on this) ✏️
- Offline functionality for enhanced privacy and security 🔐
- Voice recognition for executing predefined commands 🗣️
- Privacy-first approach with everything offline and local on the device 🏡

## Supported Platforms 🖥️

The project has been tested on x86_64 Linux, but it should theoretically work on the following platforms:

- [x] Aarch64/Arm64 Linux/Android/Raspberry Pi
- [x] Armv7l Linux/Android
- [x] Riscv64 Linux
- [x] x86 Linux/Android
- [x] x86_64 Linux/Android
- [x] 32-bit Windows (not suggested and untested)
- [x] 64-bit Windows
- [x] macOS (Intel)
- [ ] macOS (M1)
- [ ] iOS
- [ ] WebAssembly

Note: The Android build works and starts, but I can't load the speech-to-text plugin.

## To-Do's 📝

- [ ] Full customizability
- [ ] Implement Whisper.cpp backend (this will add WebAssembly, iOS, and M1 macOS support)

## Customization 🎛️

**In the near future, I'll add settings to the app!**

To customize the commands, edit the `commands/<your_language>/default.json` file.

There are some default commands. See [Add Commands](#add-commands).

## Add Commands ➕

To add your command, edit the `commands/<your_language>/default.json` file. The supported values are:

| Name        | Type             | Description                                                 | Notes                                             |
|-------------|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| `commands`  | Array of strings | All commands that the voice assistant should react to       | Required                                          |
| `funcName`  | String           | The name of the function to call (`MainWindow::<funcName>`) |                                                   |
| `responses` | Array of strings | It selects a random response from the array                 | Use `[wait <number of ms>]` to wait between words |
| `program`   | String           | A program to execute                                        |                                                   |
| `args`      | Array of strings | Arguments passed to `program`                               | `${TEXT}` will be replaced with the voice input   |
| `sound`     | String           | Path to local or remote file that gets played               | Volume can be controlled via voice/GUI            |
