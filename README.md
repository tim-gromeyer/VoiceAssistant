## Goal

The main goal of VoiceAssistant is to provide a fully customizable and extendable voice assistant that can be controlled entirely using voice commands. 

Users can define the commands in the `commands/<your_language>/default.json` file. See [Add Commands](#add-commands).

## Supported Platforms

The project has been tested on x86_64 Linux, but it should theoretically work on the following platforms:

- [x] Aarch64/Arm64 Linux/Android/Raspberry Pi
- [x] Armv7l Linux/Android
- [x] Riscv64 Linux
- [x] x86 Linux/Android
- [x] x86_64 Linux/Android
- [x] 64-Bit Windows
- [ ] MacOS (Intel)
- [ ] MacOS (M1)
- [ ] iOS
- [ ] WebAssembly

## To-Do's

- [ ] Full customizability
- [ ] Cross-platform compatibility
- [ ] Implement Whisper.cpp backend (this will increase the number of supported platforms)

## Customization

**In the near future I'll add settings to the app! **  
*I'm struggling with a plugin system for the settings and the GUI.*

To customize the commands, edit the `commands/<your_language>/default.json` file. 

There are some default commands. See [Add Commands](#add-commands).

## Add Commands

To add your own command, edit the `commands/<your_language>/default.json` file. The supported values are:
